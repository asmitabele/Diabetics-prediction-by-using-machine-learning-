#Overview<br>
Diabetes is a chronic disease with the potential to cause a worldwide health care crisis. According to International Diabetes Federation 382 million people are living with diabetes across the whole world. By 2035, this will be doubled as 592 million. Diabetes is a disease caused due to the increase level of blood glucose. This high blood glucose produces the symptoms of frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. Diabetes is a one of the leading causes of blindness, kidney failure, amputations, heart failure and stroke. When we eat, our body turns food into sugars, or glucose. At that point, our pancreas is supposed to release insulin. Insulin serves as a key to open our cells, to allow the glucose to enter and allow us to use the glucose for energy. But with diabetes, this system does not work. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the most common forms of the disease, but there are also other kinds, such as gestational diabetes, which occurs during pregnancy, as well as other forms. Machine learning is an emerging scientific field in data science dealing with the ways in which machines learn from experience. The aim of this project is to develop a system which can perform early prediction of diabetes for a patient with a higher accuracy by combining the results of different machine learning techniques. The algorithms like K nearest neighbour, Logistic Regression, Random forest, Support vector machine and Decision tree are used. The accuracy of the model using each of the algorithms is calculated. Then the one with a good accuracy is taken as the model for predicting the diabetes. <br>

#Machine Learning Models in Diabetes Prediction<br>

#Logistic Regression<br>
Logistic regression is a widely used statistical model for binary classification problems. In the context of diabetes prediction, logistic regression models the probability that a given patient has diabetes based on input features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and family history. Studies have demonstrated that logistic regression provides a baseline for comparison with more complex models, often achieving reasonable accuracy with interpretable results .<br>

#Decision Trees and Random Forests<br>
Decision trees classify data by recursively splitting it based on feature values. Random forests, an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees, enhance the predictive performance and robustness against overfitting. Research shows that random forests can effectively capture complex interactions between features in diabetes datasets, leading to high predictive accuracy .<br>

#Support Vector Machines (SVM)<br>
Support Vector Machines are powerful classifiers that find the optimal hyperplane separating data points of different classes. SVMs have been applied to diabetes prediction with success, particularly in cases where the dataset has high-dimensional features. Studies have shown that SVMs, combined with kernel functions, can achieve high accuracy and generalization in predicting diabetes .<br>

#Neural Networks<br>
Artificial neural networks (ANNs), including deep learning models, have shown great promise in diabetes prediction due to their ability to learn complex patterns from large datasets. Deep neural networks (DNNs) with multiple hidden layers can capture intricate relationships between features. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have also been explored for time-series data and image-based diabetes diagnosis .<br>

#Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)<br>
Gradient Boosting Machines, including XGBoost and LightGBM, are ensemble learning techniques that build models in a stage-wise manner. They have been highly effective in diabetes prediction due to their ability to handle various types of data and provide robust performance. Studies have highlighted the superior accuracy and feature importance insights provided by GBM models .<br>
